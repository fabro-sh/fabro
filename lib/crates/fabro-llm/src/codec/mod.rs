//! The codec seam: pure, sync translation between the canonical core
//! (`Request`/`Response`/`StreamEvent`) and a provider wire dialect.
//!
//! A codec knows *what the bytes say*. It does NOT know how they travel
//! (auth, base URL, retries, streaming transport) — that's the adapter/
//! transport layer. Everything a codec varies on arrives as data in
//! [`CodecCtx`] / [`CodecParams`]; codecs hold no per-request state.
//!
//! The trait is intentionally complete (count-tokens + error mapping have
//! defaults) so the per-dialect codecs that follow only ever *override*
//! methods, never extend the contract.

// The contract is defined in full now, but `openai_compatible` (the first
// codec) is the simplest dialect and does not exercise every seam: the
// `model`/`params` context, `RawEvent.event`, and the count-tokens methods
// are consumed by the anthropic/openai/gemini codecs and the transport
// consolidation in later PRs of this series. Scoped to this trait-definition
// file; the codec impls below are fully used.
